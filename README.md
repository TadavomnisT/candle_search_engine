# candle search engine

Those folks who used Tor alot, may remember "candle search engine" .

I believe the URL was : http://xmh57jrzrnw6insl.onion/

Not sure if it still operates...

#### Somthing look like this:

IDK the creator , and honestly IDK who used to run the system , but the logicality of the system was outstanding to me, that's why this project is dedicated to "candle search engine". 

The main aim is to use PHP alongside with Java.
The base system will be java and I'm gonna use `Apcahe-lucecne` for indexing, then a PHP wrapper will be implemented over base system to prepare APIs and eventually to run the engine as a website.
I'll probably use modular structures to provide APIs.

I intend to implement a decent web-crawler for the project later.

Let's see how it goes.
